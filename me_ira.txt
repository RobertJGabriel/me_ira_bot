**26 + 1 = 1**
**Burn everything British but their coal.**
**Ireland free from the Centre to the sea.**
**Tiocfaidh ár lá.**
**Beidh ár lá linn.**
**England's difficulty is Eire's opportunity.**
**Ní síochaín go Saoirse.**
**By ballot or gun Our day will come.**
**The road to freedom is paved with suffering, hardship, and torture.**
